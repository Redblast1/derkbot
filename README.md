## Howdy!

This Telegram bot uses the Telepot Python Framework in Python 3.4 with the telepot module. I also had to download the requests module as well, but that may not be an issue for other users.
Maybe.
The bot here is an edited and expanded version of a skeleton that is provided from [here](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot#basics). 

However, it still could be useful to others, and if you have any feedback or contributions let me know.
 
But to really learn about the telepot module, [nickoala](https://github.com/nickoala) is the best person to go to, as well as the actual page: https://github.com/nickoala/telepot .



**To install Telepot:** *(Theres some way to get it to work for Python 3.5, but I couldn't get it to work, so instead I settled on using Python 3.4)*

**1.) pip** *(Note: pip gave me problems, so I manually installed it, but it may work for you better)(Also, you may need to use pip3 or something else depending, but you probably know that)*

```
$ sudo pip install telepot
$ sudo pip install telepot --upgrade
```

**2.) Download manually:** *(Same goes for Python, I used python3.4 instead of just python since it would try to use Python 2.7, which I don't think works out too well.)*

```
$ wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/t/telepot/telepot-6.8.zip
$ unzip telepot-6.8.zip
$ cd telepot-6.8
$ python setup.py install
```

These are taken from the [Installation section on the Telepot git page](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot#installation), so any other problems or questions, it may be best to go there.

Thanks for reading!
