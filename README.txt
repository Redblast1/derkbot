Howdy!

This Telegram bot uses the Telepot python framework in python 3.4 with the telepot module. I also had to download the requests module as well, but that may not be an issue for other users. Maybe.
The bot here is an edited and expanded version of a skeleton that is provided from https://github.com/nickoala/telepot , it may not be very useful to other users since it is personally made with my friends and myself in mind.

However, it still could be useful to others, and if you have any feedback or contributions let me know. 
But to really learn about the telepot module, nickoala  is the best person to go to, as well as the actual page https://github.com/nickoala/telepot .

Thanks for reading!
